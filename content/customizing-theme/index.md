The `gatsby-starter-help-center` is built with [`typography-js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/typography-js/) and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/packages/gatsby-plugin/). This allows a high level of customization.

### Modifying the font

Edit `src/utils/typography.js` if you want to make changes to the fonts.

### Modifying the colors

Edit `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/index.js` if you want to adapt the colors, spacings and so on.
